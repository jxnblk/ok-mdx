import Box from 'superbox'

# Hello MDX

It seems to.
I personally, think this is pretty fucking rad.
But I don't know if people will necessarily want something like this.
Maybe the theme should be disabled until there's MDX highlighting

This still looks silly.

<Box
  fontSize={48}
  px={4}
  py={6}
  bg='magenta'
  css={{
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    // textTransform: 'uppercase'
  }}>
  Beep boop
</Box>
